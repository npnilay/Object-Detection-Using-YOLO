# Object-Detection-Using-YOLO
It includes the detection of objects for blind person using numpy, tensorflow and YOLO algorithm in machine learning.
By optimizing Datasets and train the model for selected labels for products using speech Recognition library to know about the object.
By optimizing the data it gives the result of the data using speech recognition library.
